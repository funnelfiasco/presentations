# Why DocBook? (a.k.a. "XML is scary")

* Widely-used industry standard
* Not that scary with the proper tools
* Provides flexibility and power
* Makes snazzy-looking docs to share with paying customers
* Suitable for being included in version control

---------

# Why not DocBook? (a.k.a. "See? I told you so!")

* Not very pretty to look at the source
* Violations of the DTD can be a pain to debug
* Sometimes it is just too much

---------

# Creating a basic document

* You could do it by hand, but why would you?
* [publican][publican] is a tool to create and build DocBook documents
* Let's try right now!

---------

# Example: create a document

* publican create --name FLOSS_Rules
